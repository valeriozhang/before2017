# before2017
Projects I have done before the year 2017 consists of 

F# - a strongly typed, multi-paradigm programming language that encompasses functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming methods. Heavily usings functional programming (e.g. Recursion)

MIPS - a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA)[1]:A-1[2]:19 developed by MIPS Technologies (formerly MIPS Computer Systems). The early MIPS architectures were 32-bit, with 64-bit versions added later. I have built circuits 32- and 64-bit circuit to create a simple arithemetic unit to do calculations. In addition, I have used MIPS to create computer generate images and animations. A very annoying language indeed.

PostgreSQL - object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and standards compliance. Used it to create database projects that utilized a online liquor/alcohol market. I create requirements and relations schema plus coded the database.

Apache Pig/Hadoop - To test distributed database systems and make search queries.

C - General-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. This is a very low level language, I have used it to code projects as simple a shell program and to code projects as large

Java- general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[14] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Garbage collection really makes this an easy language.

Python - One of the easiest languages in my general opinion. I have done image processing with convolution (simple to photoshop), created a simple word precessor like microsoft word that checks spellings, word count, etc. I have also created, my favorite project, a simple chat room that allows more than one real life user to communicate with each other.
