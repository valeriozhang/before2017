(i)
	(a)We have two jobs. The two jobs are the processes before and after the join. Before the join we have 1 map and after the join we have 2 maps. We have 0 reduces before the join and 1 reduce after the join
	(b)The schema looks like (date, type:chararray, parl:int, prov:chararray, riding:chararray, lastname:chararray, firstname:chararray, gender:chararray, occupation:chararray, party:chararray, votes:int, percent:double, elected:int, date, type:chararray, parl:int, prov:chararray, riding:chararray, lastname:chararray, firstname:chararray, gender:chararray, occupation:chararray, party:chararray, votes:int, percent:double, elected:int) after the join.
	(c)The query ran for 46 seconds and 501 milliseconds.
(ii)
	(a)Again we have two jobs. In job 1, we have 1 map and 0 reduces. In job 2, we have 2 maps and 4 reduces.
	(b)The query ran for 43 seconds and 339 milliseconds.
	(c)The query was expected to run faster than the previous. The difference is not huge, but would be very noticeable as the problem scaled up.
